# 3D Classifier

3D Classifier is a Python-based tool for classifying 3D objects using machine learning techniques. It utilizes deep learning models to classify 3D objects represented in point cloud format.

## Features

- Classification of 3D objects represented as point clouds.
- Supports various deep learning architectures for classification.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Modular design for easy integration with different datasets and models.
- Detailed documentation and examples for getting started.
